## Description
SD-Image-Organizer is a tool for organizing images generated by AI. It uses the metadata within the images to place them into subdirectories based on user-defined keywords specified in a text file.

## Features
- Extracts metadata from AI-generated images
- Organizes images into subdirectories based on metadata
- Supports drag and drop for image files
- Configurable directories for image sources and outputs

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SD-Image-Organizer.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the base directory:
    ```sh
    cd SD-Image-Organizer
    ```
3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Modify `locations.txt` or `characters.txt` in the `wildcards` directory to add new locations or characters, one per line.
2. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

### Drag and Drop
Drag and drop an image generated by Stable Diffusion or ComfyUI onto the "Drag Drop Image Here" section. This will parse your image so the information can be easily read and copied into another application. You can also press the 'Open Image' button to open a specific image.

### Batch Processing
At the bottom, there is a section that allows you to batch process a directory, read each image's metadata in that directory, and then move the image into a specified output directory. You will need to modify `characters.txt` within the `wildcards` directory to identify a keyword within the image to categorize it.
*Note: Images moved into a directory with a similarly named image will be auto-renamed with a new number (nothing will be replaced).
